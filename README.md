# JSB-Chorales-dataset
Dataset for JSB Chorales at different temporal resolutions, with train, validation, test split from [Boulanger-Lewandowski (2012)][nicolas-data].

Three temporal resolutions are provided: quarter, 8th, 16th. These "quantizations" are created by retaining the pitches heard on the specified temporal grid.  Boulanger-Lewandowski (2012) uses a temporal resolution of quarter notes.

This dataset currently does not encode fermatas and also does not distinguish between held and repeated notes.

## To load the data:

In Python 2:

```python
import cPickle as pickle
with open('jsb-chorales-16th.pkl', 'rb') as p:
    data = pickle.load(p)
```

In Python 3:

```python
import pickle
with open('jsb-chorales-16th.pkl', 'rb') as p:
    data = pickle.load(p, encoding="latin1")
```

From Boulanger-Lewandowski (2012): "This will load a dictionary with 'train', 'valid' and 'test' keys, with the corresponding values being a list of sequences. Each sequence is itself a list of time steps, and each time step is a list of the non-zero elements in the piano-roll at this instant (in MIDI note numbers, between 21 and 108 inclusive)".

Additionally, the file `Jsb16thSeparated.npz` contains the same data in the format used in Coconet ([Huang & Cooijmans et al., 2017][coconet]).  This format is like the above format except that at each time step there are exactly four numbers; one pitch for each of the SATB voices. If a voice is silent at a given time step, its pitch is NaN. This file was created based on the data included with the source code from https://github.com/johndpope/allan-harmony, but it contains the same data with the same train/valid/test split as the Boulanger-Lewandowski files.

## JSON formats

To sidestep Pickle/Numpy oddities once and for all, all of the above are now also available in the more straightforward JSON format. For `Jsb16thSeparated.json`, silence is represented by a pitch of `-1` rather than `NaN`.
